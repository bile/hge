1. HGE_parallax_t
2. trigger system

x_t = x_0 + t*v_0 + a/2*t^2
v_t = v_0 + a*t

x_0 is the current position
v_0 is the current valocity
a is the acceleration
t is the change in time
x_t is the new position
v_t is the new valocity

HGE like particle emitter:
Emitter variables:
 0. Emitter lifetime
 1. Particle count
 2. min particle life
 3. max particle life
 4. direction of emittion
 5. spread
 6,7   X,Y min/max
 8,9   VX,VY min/max
 10,11 AX,AY min/max
